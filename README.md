# Hexa Game Engine
Hexa is primarily an early-stage game enigne powered by C++ & SDL2 which is inspired by TheCherno's Hazel Engine. As of now it's an early-stage game engine which can be used to make simple 2D games. Currently not much is implemented, however the developement for Hexa is being shared on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Le1afwfm3CY)

***

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, Hexa is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Light-Lens/Hexa`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

## The Plan
The plan for Hexa is two-fold: to create a powerful 2D engine, but also to serve as an education tool for teaching game engine design and architecture.

## Instructions
### Requirments
You need to install the following on your machine.
- Mingw-w64
- Visual Studio Code

## License and Contributions
All code is licensed under an MIT license. This allows you to re-use the code freely, remixed in both commercial and non-commercial projects. The only requirement is to include the same license when distributing.

We welcome any contributions to Hexa Engine development through pull requests on GitHub. Most of our active development is in the master branch, so we prefer to take pull requests there (particularly for new features).
